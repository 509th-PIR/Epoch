## [0.6.0.0] - TBA
### Added
- Vector Base Building (uses Arrow keys by default and with SHIFT / ALT you can control the steps). @DirtySanchez & @Ignatz-Heman
- Base Building elements can be detached to walk around the Element before saving. @Ignatz-Heman
- Helper arrow to indicate door-opening direction for Base Building. @Ignatz-Heman
- Option to drink directly from water sources. @Ignatz-HeMan
- Epoch Events 3.0: Allow external events based on server side configs and pbos. New server side events can be added just dropping the pbo into @epochhive/addons folder. To make your own use Dynamic Debris Event as a template.
- Dynamic Debris: Dynamically spawns vehicle and other debris on the roadways. Scans the roads on startup and uses a random seed generator to determine the locations of debris. Debris is spawned using createSimpleObject for best performance and is made to conform with the upper most roadway surface.
- Epoch Dev Libs, See https://github.com/EpochModTeam/Epoch/tree/experimental/Tools/DevFrameWork for more info. @raymix
- Md5 hash function and Unit test to hive. See usage example with EPOCH_fnc_server_hiveMD5 SQF function.

### Fixed
- Base Building 90째 and 270째 Snap was broken.
- Sometimes snapped Base Building elements rotated back on save.
- BE kick since 1.70.

### Changed
- Base Building: Replaced 0/90/180/270째 direction build mode with "Rotate 90째". @Ignatz-Heman
- Base Building: Max building height now will be checked directly at building element placement. @Ignatz-Heman
- Separated Hunger and Thirst loss values to baseHungerLoss/baseThirstLoss and removed baseHTLoss from CfgEpochClient.
- Hunger and Thirst loss rates are now effected by timeMultiplier.
- Bump to hive version 0.6.0.0, Note: this requires epochserver(_x64).dll/so hive extension updates server side.
