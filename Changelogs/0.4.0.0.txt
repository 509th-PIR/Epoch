Server Side Only:
[New] EpochServer.dll/so is now statically linked to pcre3 and hredis. On Windows this means that the pcre3.dll file in the arma 3 root can now be removed. On Linux we no longer depend on libhredis and libpcre to be installed.
[Fixed] Database logging now trims log entries via the LogLimit setting  provided in EpochServer.ini. The default is 1000 log records per list.

Known Issues:
Jetski and Electric Motorcycle motorcycle in-vehicle HUD will not initialize if player is spawned inside vehicle, as display getin EH did not fire.
